# CORS Issues Fix for Packages API

## Problem

The `/api/packages` endpoint was showing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors on some PCs when accessed from browsers. This happens because:

1. **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers enforce a security policy that blocks requests from one domain to another unless explicitly allowed
2. **Missing CORS Headers**: The API routes were not returning the necessary CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests
3. **Preflight Requests**: Modern browsers send OPTIONS requests before actual requests to check if cross-origin access is allowed

## Root Cause

- The API routes (`/api/packages` and `/api/packages/[id]`) were missing CORS headers
- No OPTIONS handler was implemented for preflight requests
- Different browsers and network configurations handle CORS differently, explaining why it worked on some PCs but not others

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created CORS Utility (`/lib/cors.ts`)

- Centralized CORS configuration
- Origin-aware CORS headers
- Support for development and production environments
- Handles preflight OPTIONS requests

### 2. Updated API Routes

- Added OPTIONS handlers for preflight requests
- Added CORS headers to all responses (success and error)
- Origin-aware responses for better security

### 3. Security Features

- **Allowed Origins**: Configured specific domains instead of wildcard `*`
- **Development Support**: More permissive in development mode
- **Production Security**: Restricted to specific domains in production

## Why Some PCs Showed Errors While Others Didn't

1. **Browser Differences**: Different browsers implement CORS slightly differently
2. **Network Configuration**: Corporate firewalls or proxy servers may handle preflight requests differently
3. **Cache Behavior**: Some browsers cache preflight responses, others don't
4. **Browser Extensions**: Ad blockers or security extensions can affect CORS behavior
5. **Development Tools**: Having dev tools open can change how requests are sent

## Testing

You can test the fix by making requests from different origins:

```javascript
// From browser console on a different domain
fetch('https://www.qodwaplatform.com/api/packages')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Configuration

The allowed origins are configured in `/lib/cors.ts`:

- `https://www.qodwaplatform.com`
- `https://qodwaplatform.com`
- `http://localhost:3000` (development)
- `http://localhost:3001` (development)

Add new domains to the `allowedOrigins` array as needed.
